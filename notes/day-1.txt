Day 1
LLMs and prompting (1,5h)
We get started with connecting to an LLM and sending it prompts.
llms (local , cloud) & basic prompting
advanced prompting: Few show prompting, CoT, ToT
LLM Frameworks: llamindex, langchain, â€¦

Testing: (1,5h)
Just as in traditional software development, we need to test our application.
building evals
explore llm as a judge, vs manual testing
prompt refactoring and rewriting

RAG & Graph databases (2h)
We then connect our llms with our own data sources and show we can improve the results and reduce hallucinations.
understanding Search / Vector databases
explore different embedding models
show the importance of Chunking , Loaders strategies
How to improve results with Re-ranking
use GraphRAG as an additional knowledge source

genAI Infra: (0.5h)
Once we finished our app, we are ready to deploy it and explore the required infra to run it.
look at hosting options
explain the different nference speed factors
how to do model, prompt, app versioning
use of proxies such as llm proxy , llmlite
intelligent llm routing
introduce caching / embeddings
look at different costs models

Security & Operations: (1.5h)
In production we need to monitor our application and protect it from attacks.
metrics that matter
how does observability fit in
provide guardrails to generation
anticipate and protect against prompt injection
