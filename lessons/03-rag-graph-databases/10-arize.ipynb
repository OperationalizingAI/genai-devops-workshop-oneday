    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on vast datasets, but these will not include your specific data (things like company knowledge bases and documentation). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by dynamically incorporating your data as context during the generation process. This is done not by altering the training data of the LLMs but by allowing the model to access and utilize your data in real-time to provide more tailored and contextually relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RAG, your data is loaded and prepared for queries. This process is called indexing. User queries act on this index, which filters your data down to the most relevant context. This context and your query then are sent to the LLM along with a prompt, and the LLM provides a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a critical component for building applications such a chatbots or agents and you will want to know RAG techniques on how to get data into your application.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are five key stages within RAG, which will in turn be a part of any larger RAG application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loading**: This refers to getting your data from where it lives - whether it's text files, PDFs, another website, a database or an API - into your pipeline.\n",
    "- **Indexing**: This means creating a data structure that allows for querying the data. For LLMs this nearly always means creating vector embeddings, numerical representations of the meaning of your data, as well as numerous other metadata strategies to make it easy to accurately find contextually relevant data.\n",
    "- **Storing**: Once your data is indexed, you will want to store your index, along with any other metadata, to avoid the need to re-index it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying**: For any given indexing strategy there are many ways you can utilize LLMs and data structures to query, including sub-queries, multi-step queries, and hybrid strategies. \n",
    "- **Evaluation**: A critical step in any pipeline is checking how effective it is relative to other strategies, or when you make changes. Evaluation provides objective measures on how accurate, faithful, and fast your responses to queries are.\n"

       "'What I Worked On\\n\\nFebruary 2021\\n\\nBefore college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn\\'t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.\\n\\nThe first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called \"data processing.\" This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district\\'s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain\\'s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines ‚Äî CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader ‚Äî sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights.\\n\\nThe language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the card reader and press a button to load the program into memory and run it. The result would ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.\\n\\nI was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn\\'t figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there\\'s not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn\\'t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn\\'t rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn\\'t know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I\\'m not surprised I can\\'t remember any programs I wrote, because they can\\'t have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn\\'t. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager\\'s expression made clear.\\n\\nWith microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping.'"

       "\"Except for a few officially anointed thinkers who went to the right parties in New York, the only people allowed to publish essays were specialists writing about their specialties. There were so many essays that had never been written, because there had been no way to publish them. Now they could be, and I was going to write them. [12]\\n\\nI've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.\\n\\nI knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first. Socially they'd seem more like rants posted by nutjobs on their GeoCities sites than the genteel and beautifully typeset compositions published in The New Yorker. But by this point I knew enough to find that encouraging instead of discouraging.\\n\\nOne of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site. Even Lisp, though prestigious intellectually in something like the way Latin is, also seems about as hip.\\n\\nIt's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.\\n\\nOver the next several years I wrote lots of essays about all kinds of different topics. O'Reilly reprinted a collection of them as a book, called Hackers & Painters after one of the essays in it. I also worked on spam filters, and did some more painting.\""

      "Question: What were the two main things the author worked on before college?\n",
      "Answer: The author worked on writing and programming before college.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's initial approach to AI, and why did they realize it was not going to work?\n",
      "Answer: The author's initial approach to AI involved using programs that utilized explicit data structures to represent concepts based on natural language input. However, the author realized that this approach was not going to work because it only demonstrated a subset of natural language as a formal language, showing an unbridgeable gap between what the programs could do and actual understanding of natural language. The author concluded that teaching these programs more words or applying band-aids would not solve the fundamental issue with this approach to AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What new approach did the author experiment with in their painting, involving using a printed canvas as an underpainting for a second still life?\n",
      "Answer: The author experimented with a new approach in their painting by using a printed canvas as an underpainting for a second still life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the job the author took at Interleaf and how did it differ from their previous experiences?\n",
      "Answer: The job the author took at Interleaf was to write in a scripting language that was a dialect of Lisp. This job differed from their previous experiences as it was the closest thing they had to a normal job, where they were expected to show up every day during certain working hours, which the author found unnatural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the turning point for the author in figuring out what to work on?\n",
      "Answer: The turning point for the author in figuring out what to work on was when they started publishing essays online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Explain the significance of YC becoming a fund in 2009 and then reverting back to being self-funded.\n",
      "Answer: The significance of YC becoming a fund in 2009 was due to its growth and size, which made it financially unsustainable for the founders to continue funding it personally. However, reverting back to being self-funded after Heroku's acquisition provided YC with the financial stability to operate independently without relying on external funding sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author feel about the value of their Viaweb stock before it was acquired by Yahoo?\n",
      "Answer: The author did not feel that their Viaweb stock was very valuable before it was acquired by Yahoo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the initial reason for starting Viaweb according to the author?\n",
      "Answer: The initial reason for starting Viaweb according to the author was the need for money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reason behind the decision to hand over control of Y Combinator (YC) to someone else?\n",
      "Answer: The reason behind the decision to hand over control of Y Combinator (YC) to someone else was the realization that YC was taking up more attention and becoming the main focus, potentially being the last thing the individual did if they continued on the current trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's experience with painting still lives influence their perception of everyday visual stimuli?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with painting still lives led them to become more conscious and attentive to details in everyday visual stimuli. This heightened awareness was a result of the necessity to closely observe and capture intricate details while painting still lives, which contrasted with the more automated and generalized visual perception that occurs in everyday life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Describe the author's experience with programming on the IBM 1401 in 9th grade.\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with programming on the IBM 1401 in 9th grade involved using an early version of Fortran. Programs had to be typed on punch cards, stacked in the card reader, and then loaded into memory to run. The author found the machine puzzling as the only input option was data stored on punched cards, which they didn't have. Due to limited options for input and their lack of advanced mathematical knowledge, the author couldn't do much with the IBM 1401. They recall a moment when they learned that programs could fail to terminate, which caused an issue with the data center manager.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to focus on Lisp and write a book about Lisp hacking?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to focus on Lisp and write a book about Lisp hacking because they found Lisp interesting for its own sake, not just for its association with AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What idea did the author have in the spring of 2000 that they believed was the future, leading them to decide to start a new company in Cambridge?\n",
      "Answer: The author had the idea to build a web app for making web apps, allowing people to edit code on a server through the browser and host the resulting applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author manage to save enough money to go back to RISD and pay off their college loans while working at Interleaf?\n",
      "Answer: The author managed to save enough money to go back to RISD and pay off their college loans while working at Interleaf by getting paid significant amounts of money, especially compared to art student standards. Despite living frugally, the author was able to save a substantial amount due to the high pay received at Interleaf, which allowed them to achieve their financial goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why does the author believe that working on unprestigious things can be a sign of having the right motives?\n",
      "Answer: Working on unprestigious things can be a sign of having the right motives because it indicates a genuine interest in the work itself rather than a desire to impress others. This focus on the work itself suggests a sincere dedication to exploring and discovering something meaningful, rather than being motivated by external validation or prestige.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What is the problem highlighted in paragraph 17 regarding running a forum and writing essays simultaneously?\n",
      "Answer: The problem highlighted in paragraph 17 regarding running a forum and writing essays simultaneously is the challenge of balancing the two activities effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author feel worn out during the year following the acquisition by Yahoo?\n",
      "Answer: The author felt worn out during the year following the acquisition by Yahoo due to the effort and stress of running Viaweb.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author decide to build a subset of the new architecture as an open source project?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to build a subset of the new architecture as an open source project because they realized they no longer wanted to run a company, especially a large one. They had initially started the company out of financial necessity, but once that need was no longer present, they questioned the purpose of pursuing the vision as a commercial venture. This led them to opt for developing a subset of the architecture as an open source project instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the reorganization of YC take place and who were the key individuals involved in the process?\n",
      "Answer: The reorganization of YC took place when the original founders decided to hand over control to ensure its longevity. Sam Altman was recruited to take over as president, leading to a complete changing of the guard. The key individuals involved in the process were the original founders, including Paul Graham, Jessica, Robert, and Trevor, who agreed to let Sam reorganize YC. Paul Graham and Robert Morris would retire, while Jessica and Trevor would become ordinary partners under Sam's leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's reason for leaving the Accademia after the first year of study?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to leave the Accademia after the first year of study because the faculty and students had an arrangement where teaching and learning were not emphasized, and the environment did not align with the author's expectations of a productive learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: How did the author's experience with microcomputers differ from working with the IBM 1401?\n",
      "Answer: The author's experience with microcomputers differed from working with the IBM 1401 in that with microcomputers, they could have a computer right in front of them on a desk that could respond to their keystrokes as it was running, instead of relying on punch cards for input and stopping after processing a stack of punch cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the author's dilemma between theory and systems work in computer science, and why did they ultimately want to build things that would last?\n",
      "Answer: The author's dilemma in computer science was between theory and systems work. They leaned towards building things rather than proving things, finding the act of creating more exciting. However, the issue with systems work was its transience - any program they wrote would become obsolete in a couple of decades. This led the author to desire to build things that would last, seeking a more enduring impact from their work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: Why did the author's friend Robert refuse to work on the new idea for a web app, despite agreeing that it sounded plausible?\n",
      "Answer: Robert refused to work on the new idea for a web app because he had previously experienced that working on one of the author's schemes had been a huge time sink, even though it had been financially rewarding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were some of the challenges the author faced while working at Interleaf, and what did they learn from this experience?\n",
      "Answer: The author faced challenges such as struggling with the company's software due to its complexity, feeling like a bad employee because of their lack of understanding and irresponsibility, and finding it difficult to adhere to traditional working hours. From this experience, the author learned that it's better for technology companies to be led by product-oriented individuals rather than sales-focused ones, that editing code by multiple individuals can lead to bugs, that office environment plays a significant role in productivity, that spontaneous conversations are often more effective than planned meetings, that bureaucratic clients can be risky, and that there is a mismatch between conventional office hours and optimal hacking times. Additionally, the author learned the importance of being the \"entry level\" option in a market to avoid being overtaken by competitors, highlighting that prestige can sometimes be a warning sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What were some of the different topics the author wrote essays about over the next several years?\n",
      "Answer: The author wrote essays about a variety of different topics over the next several years, including their experiences with Lisp, the use of Lisp at Viaweb, the implications of the web for publishing, the changing landscape of essay publication, and the newfound ability for anyone to publish content online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: According to the text, how does the concept of invented vs discovered relate to the potential knowledge of space aliens?\n",
      "Answer: Presumably aliens need numbers and errors and I/O too. So it seems likely there exists at least one path out of McCarthy's Lisp along which discoveredness is preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the reaction of the author's boss at Yahoo when the author announced their plans to leave the company?\n",
      "Answer: The author's boss at Yahoo had a long conversation with the author about their plans when they announced they were leaving. The boss seemed to take a keen interest in the author's plans, which the author initially found touching. However, in hindsight, it is revealed that the boss may have thought the author was lying about their intentions to leave, possibly suspecting that the author was planning to start a new startup and take people with them, considering the valuable stock options the author had at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What was the name of the new company the author planned to start, and why did they ultimately decide not to pursue it as a big company?\n",
      "Answer: The author planned to start a company called Viaweb. They ultimately decided not to pursue it as a big company because they realized they did not want to run a big company, especially since they had only started Viaweb because they needed money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: After the passing of the author's mother, what did the author decide to do next and why?\n",
      "Answer: The author decided to focus on painting after the passing of their mother because they wanted to see how good they could get if they really focused on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question: What unique feature did Interleaf software have that was inspired by Emacs and involved a scripting language?\n",
      "Answer: Interleaf software had a unique feature where they added a scripting language inspired by Emacs, and they made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp.\n",
