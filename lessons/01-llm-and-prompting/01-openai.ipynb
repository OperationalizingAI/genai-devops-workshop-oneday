    "## Introduction\n",
    "[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) is the company behind Chatgpt and is the most popular Large Language Model (LLM) provider. It is offered as a SaaS solution. Azure OpenAI from Microsoft has an offering that provides the same model but within an Azure Environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When OpenAI initally launched they offered an LLM model called `gpt-3`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model types\n",
    "Now they provide many different models such as : <https://platform.openai.com/docs/models>\n",
    "- `gpt-4-turbo` is a large multimodal model (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text) that can solve difficult problems with greater accuracy than any of our previous models, thanks to its broader general knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilitie   \n",
    "- `gpt-4o` (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient—it generates text 2x faster and is 50% cheaper\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini` (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model in the small models category, and our cheapest model yet. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), has higher intelligence than gpt-3.5-turbo but is just as fast. It is meant to be used for smaller tasks, including vision tasks."
