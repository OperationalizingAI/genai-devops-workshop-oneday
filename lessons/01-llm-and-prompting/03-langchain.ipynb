    "We'd want to avoid rewriting our code , just to change the llm.\n",

    "One way of abstracting this, is to use an *orchestration framework` such as *Langchain*. It is the initial framework that generated a lot of buzz. See <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then other frameworks such as *LLamaIndex* <https://www.llamaindex.ai/> emerged. They have different philosophies but are often converging to the same functinoality.\n"

      "DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The primary goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, increase deployment frequency, and deliver high-quality software in a more efficient and reliable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key principles and components of DevOps include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Collaboration and Communication**: DevOps emphasizes breaking down silos between development and operations teams, promoting a culture of shared responsibility and collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Automation**: Automation of repetitive tasks, such as testing, integration, and deployment, is a core principle of DevOps. This helps to reduce human error and increase the speed of software delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: CI/CD practices involve automatically integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying applications to production environments. This enables teams to release updates more frequently and reliably.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure is essential for identifying issues and gathering feedback from users. This information can be used to make informed decisions about future development and operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through code and automation, which allows for consistency and scalability in environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cultural Change**: DevOps fosters a culture of experimentation, learning, and innovation, encouraging teams to adopt practices like blameless postmortems and iterative improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, DevOps aims to create a more agile, responsive, and efficient approach to software development and operations, ultimately leading to better products and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n"
