    "One way of abstracting this, is to use an *orchestration framework` such as *Langchain*. It is the initial framework that generated a lot of buzz. See <https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain>\n",

    "Since then other frameworks such as *LLamaIndex* <https://www.llamaindex.ai/> emerged. They have different philosophies but are often converging to the same functinoality.\n"

      "DevOps is a set of practices, principles, and cultural philosophies that aim to improve collaboration and communication between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. The goal of DevOps is to shorten the software development lifecycle, increase the frequency of software releases, and enhance the quality and reliability of software products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key aspects of DevOps include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Collaboration**: DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between developers, operations teams, and other stakeholders, breaking down traditional silos that can hinder communication and productivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Automation**: DevOps emphasizes the automation of various processes, including code integration, testing, deployment, and infrastructure management. Automation helps reduce manual errors, speeds up processes, and allows teams to focus on higher-level tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: CI/CD practices involve frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository and automating the deployment of applications to production environments. This leads to faster feedback and more reliable releases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitoring and Feedback**: DevOps encourages continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure to gather insights on performance, usage, and potential issues. Feedback loops enable teams to make data-driven decisions and improve their processes and products.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: IaC involves managing infrastructure through code and automation tools, allowing teams to provision and manage resources like servers and networks in a consistent and repeatable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Cultural Change**: DevOps promotes a cultural shift within organizations to embrace agility, experimentation, and open communication. Teams are encouraged to learn from failures and continuously improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, DevOps aims to create a more efficient and responsive software development environment, enabling organizations to deliver high-quality software faster and more reliably.\n"
