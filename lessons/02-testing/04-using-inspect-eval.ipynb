    "## Introduction\n",
    "- As we've seen in the lesson about simple testing, changing the prompt slightly and senting it to the same llm can give different results.\n",
    "- Imagine swapping in and out another model, how do you make sure your code keeps working?\n",
    "- Much like in Test Driven Development, the LLM community talks about *Evals*\n",
    "- Evals can be seen as a test suite to check the results across multiple prompts and llms\n",
    "- We've seen how it works, but luckily there exist frameworks that have some helpers , so we don't have to do it all by ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework we will show here is `Inspect AI` - <https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/>. It comes in the form of a VSCode plugin too, this is eanbled in this workshop."
